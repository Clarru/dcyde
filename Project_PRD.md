## Executive Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Product Name** | Dcyde |
| **Vision** | Transform task chaos into strategic clarity through visual prioritization |
| **Target Market** | Knowledge workers, managers, freelancers, and students overwhelmed by task management |

| **Launch Timeline** | MVP: 4 weeks, Full Release: 12 weeks |

## 1. Product Vision & Strategy

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**The Hidden Crisis of Modern Work:**
- **73%** of professionals use 3+ task management tools simultaneously
- Average knowledge worker spends **28 minutes daily** just deciding what to work on
- **91%** report feeling overwhelmed by their task list at least weekly
- Current tools optimize for feature count, not decision speed

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
Traditional To-Do Lists → Everything looks equally important
Multiple Tools → Context switching and duplicate work  
Complex Software → High friction to capture and organize
No Visual Hierarchy → Mental overhead to prioritize
```

### 1.2 Solution Philosophy

**Core Principle:** *"The best task manager is invisible—it just shows you what to do next."*

Dcyde uses spatial organization and visual hierarchy to make prioritization automatic. By mapping tasks to the time-tested Eisenhower Matrix, users instantly see not just what to do, but what NOT to do.

### 1.3 Target Personas

**Primary: "Overwhelmed Oliver" (70% of users)**
- Mid-level manager or senior IC
- 15-50 tasks active at any time
- Uses email as unofficial task list
- Pain: "Everything feels urgent"
- Goal: Regain control without learning new system

**Secondary: "Systematic Sarah" (20% of users)**
- Project manager or team lead
- Already uses task management tools
- Pain: "My system takes too much maintenance"
- Goal: Streamline without losing functionality

**Tertiary: "Freelancer Felix" (10% of users)**
- Juggling multiple clients/projects
- Irregular work patterns
- Pain: "Can't see the forest for the trees"
- Goal: Balance urgent client work with business growth

## 2. Core Features - MVP

### 2.1 Task Capture & Input

**Lightning-Fast Entry**
- Single keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + Space) opens quick capture
- Natural language processing: "Call mom tomorrow" → Scheduled task
- Email integration: Forward to tasks@focusmatrix.pro
- Voice input on mobile
- Bulk import from CSV/other tools

**Smart Defaults**
```javascript
taskDefaults = {
  quadrant: 'unassigned',  // Forces conscious decision
  dueDate: null,           // Prevents fake urgency
  reminder: 'smart',       // AI suggests based on type
  color: 'auto'           // Based on keywords/project
}
```

### 2.2 The Matrix Interface

**Visual Hierarchy**
```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ 🔥 DO FIRST            │ 📅 SCHEDULE            │
│ Crisis & Deadlines      │ Planning & Growth      │
│                         │                        │
│ Red (#DC2626)          │ Blue (#2563EB)         │
│ Pulsing edges          │ Calm, stable           │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ 🤝 DELEGATE            │ ❌ ELIMINATE           │
│ Interruptions          │ Time Wasters           │
│                        │                        │
│ Yellow (#D97706)       │ Gray (#6B7280)         │
│ Slight movement        │ Faded appearance       │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction Patterns**

### 2.3 Task Intelligence

**Auto-Categorization Engine**
```python

  'delegate': ['meeting', 'call', 'coordinate', 'check with'],
  'eliminate': ['maybe', 'someday', 'would be nice', 'fyi']
}
```

**Smart Suggestions**
- "This task has been in 'Schedule' for 30 days. Still important?"

4. **Accessible Power**: Advanced features discoverable, not overwhelming

**Component Library**
```css
/* Core tokens */
--radius-sm: 4px;
--radius-md: 8px;
--shadow-task: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
--shadow-hover: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
--transition-default: all 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
```
